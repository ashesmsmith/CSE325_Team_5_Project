**Savings Tracker**

**Summary**  
Our project will be a Savings Tracking App. Users will be able to create an account and set multiple savings goals. The user will be able to set their own name/description for the goal, the amount they want to save, and the date they want to complete the goal. They will be able to edit and delete the goals as needed. Each goal will track transactions, deposits, and withdrawals, associated with the goal. The transactions are also able to be edited or deleted as needed. Each transaction will have a date, amount, type, and description. If we have time, we also want to enable reminders and notifications for the goals. Reminders would have optional frequency to remind the user to save for that goal. Notifications would be for different stages of success with the goal such as half way, 10% to go, and so on. The target audience for the application is anyone who wants to have a way to better track their savings goals and may need extra motivation to do so.
