# Savings Tracker

## Summary

Our project is a Savings Tracking App that allows users to create an account and manage multiple savings goals. Users can assign a customer name and description to each goal, set a target amount, and specify a completion date. Goals can be edited or deleted at any time. Each goal tracks associated transactions, including deposits, and withdrawals, which can also be modified or deleted. Every transaction will include a date, amount, type, and description. 

If time permits, we also plan to implement reminders and notifications to help users stay on track. Reminders can have customizable frequencies to encourage consistent saving, while notifications will alert users at key milestones, such as reaching 50% of the goal or being within 10% of completion.

The target audience for the application includes anyone who wants a simple, organized way to track their savings goals and gain extra motivation to achieve them.
